viii SIGHT READING IN LATIN

If the structure is still not clear, the pupil should read the sen-
tence again and again, following the same method, till the light
comes. Sometimes the difficulty arises from an ignorance of some
principle of syntax or an uncertainty about a form, which must be
cleared up by reference to the grammarÍ¾ or it may come from the
hazy memory of the meaning of a word.

After all this the meaning of the whole sentence should be fairly
certain, and it should not be a difficult matter to put it into Eng-
lish. If the meaning of a word has escaped the memory, leave a
blank for this word in translating the sentence, and often the trans-
lation will show what meaning the unknown word must have.

It may seem that this requires much time and is a slow way of
getting at the meaning. It is true that for a while this will be so.
But the mind must be trained to grasp the meaning of the sen-
tence in the order in which the Roman author developed it in his
own mind, and in the order in which he put it in writing. The
emphasis in a sentence is lost if the sentence is not read and inter-
preted in the order in which it is written. This is the only method
that leads to accuracy and rapidity in understanding the language3
for the Romans were particular about the placing of words, and
the study of arrangement, therefore, is of the utmost importance.
