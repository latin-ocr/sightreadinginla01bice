SUGGESTIONS FOR READING AT SIGHT

To understand a Latin sentence three things must be known:
the forms, the relations of the words to one another, and their
meanings. Each one of these must be noted and remembered
While the sentence is passing under the eye of the reader.

First, then, read each sentence through slowly and thoughtfully,
aloud if possible, trying to decide, when each word is reached, what
its form is or may be. Do not, when reading the sentence for the
first or even for the second time, let the eye jump from place to
place, but take each word as it comes. Often the next word will
make plain the form of the one before it. Sometimes the form
will be perfectly plain when the end of the sentence is reached.
Sometimes a word may be in any one of several forms, and the
first reading may not show which one it is.

After having read the sentence through in this way one or more
times with the forms chiefly in mind, read it once more, trying to
see rather how the words are related to one another. Of course it
is not possible to avoid doing this to some extent when the sentence
is read the first time, but put the attention strongly on this point
now. The meanings of many of the words will naturally rise in
the mind while this is being done, and will help to show the con-
nection between the parts of the different phrases, for the other
readings will have made it clear that the sentence contains a number
of groups of wOrdS, perhaps prepositional phrases, perhaps nouns
limited by anv adjective or by a genitive or an ablative, or perhaps
clauses of one kind or another. By omitting these mentally in the
reading, when they are discovered, the simple, independent stateâ€”
ment, which is the real backbone of the sentence, will be found.
After this, another reading will usually show the relation which these

groups have to one another and to the main statement.
