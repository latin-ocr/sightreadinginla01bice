(1“A Roman School'’ and “A Roman Wedding⁷’ are the only
dramatizations in Latin which are in any way suitable for reproduc-
tion in the high schools. They were written by the author for the
purpose of creating a new interest in the study of the classics among
secondary pupils, and, as given already in several schools, have
proved an effective stimulus to the class work.

&The plays give in turn a picture of school life in the days of
Caesar and Cicero, and again, of a high-class Roman wedding in the
same period.

ss} The greatest care has been taken to make the detail authentic
and the descriptions true to life. The diction is accurately classic,
and there is plenty of humor and action.

(1 As a means of producing a genuine appreciation of Roman life
and customs, and of making real the character of Latin literature,
the book has unusual educational value.
