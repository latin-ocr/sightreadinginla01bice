DE BELLO GALLICO, V 119

NOTES

1 navis aedificandas: Caesar intended to make a second expedition to
Britain. ‘2 formam: English derivative ? 3 quibus: understand eas as
antecedent. 4 e6: χόν this reason. 5 fieri: become. ⁶ humilitas:
derivation? 7 apportari: ad -†— ports). ⁸ conventibus: the courts of jus-
tice over which the provincial governor presided. 9 imperat: levies.
10 percepta: synonym of cognosco.

Think of English words from aedificandas, onera, conventibus, doceant,
arbitros, aestiment, and observe how the meaning of the Latin word helps
to make plain the meaning of the English.

Six hundred ships of the kind described above and twenty-eight war
vessels are built for Caesar. He orders them to assemble at Portus Itius,
ready for the passage to Britain. He himself with four legions and eight
hundred horsemen invades the land of the Treveri, who have disregarded
his commands.
