PREFACE

The material for sight reading offered in this book may be
used in two ways. Teachers who believe that the passage for
translation should be placed before the pupil without prepa-
ration, will suggest for his use nothing more than the vocabulary
of new wordS‚ the notes, and the rule of order accompanying
each selection. T hose who believe that some preparation should
be made will find material suggested at the beginning of each
exercise.

The grammatical references are to the common constructions
found in the reading prescribed for the second year, and are illus-
trated in the selection which they introduce. The words which may
be made the basis of a drill in inflections, as well as the words in
the so-called “prescribed list‚'⁷ also occur in the passage. The
latter are to be found in Professor Lodge's List. They include
two classes: those which occur for the first time in Books III,
IV, and V of the Gallic War, and those which have not occurred
often or which may not have been met by the pupil in his reading
of Books I and ΙΙ up to the time when he sees the passage for
sight work. The words of the first class are printed in heavy-faced
type in the prescribed list, and in the text of the exercises when
the lists are discontinued. The meanings should be given by the
teacher. The rules relating to the arrangement of the words in
the sentence are intended to guide the pupil in observing the
grouping of words and their dependence.

The meaning of every word in the passage is given if not found
in Lodge’s List. Each exercise is complete in itself. Words are
therefore repeated whenever necessary, even though they have

appeared in previous exercises.
