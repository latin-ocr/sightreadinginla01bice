iv SIGHT READING IN LATIN

The book contains rather more matter than is included in
Books HI and IV of the Gallie War. The first thirty exercises
are taken from Eutropius, Aulus Gellius, Pliny, Cicero, and Livy.
In some cases needed modifications have been made in the Latin,
especially in the Livy.

The other exercises are taken from Nepos's lives of Hannibal
and Hamilcar, from Caesar's Civil W ar, and from Books ΠΙ to VII,
inclusive, of the Gallie War. In every case the attempt has been
made to have the Latin tell a complete episode or story in a series
of exercises. Where chapters have been omitted, a re'sume of the
contents is given in English.
